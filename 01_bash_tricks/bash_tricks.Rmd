## Setting up passwordless authentication for ssh

* Generate a key pair:
   - private key: stays on your computer
   - public key: put it on the server
   
Using the public key the server can check that a request comes from
your computer. 

```bash
# generate a key pair
ssh-keygen

# copy the key pair on the server
ssh-copy-id user@zeus
```

## Neat tricks

 * **Ctrl + R**: search your history
 * `cd -`: change to the previous directory

## tmux

* Terminal multiplexer

## Useful programs

 * `tldr`: Drop-in replacement for `man`

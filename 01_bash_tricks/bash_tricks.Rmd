## Setting up passwordless authentication for ssh

* Generate a key pair:
   - private key: stays on your computer
   - public key: put it on the server
   
Using the public key the server can check that a request comes from
your computer. 

```bash
# generate a key pair
ssh-keygen

# copy the key pair on the server
ssh-copy-id user@zeus
```

## Basics
 * `cd `: return to home directory
 * `pwd`: get current working directory
 * `mkdir`, `rm`, `ls`, `rmdir`, `mv`
 * `tar xvf`, `tar cvf`
 * `gzip`, `gunzip`, `pigz`
 * `cp`, `ln`, `ln -s`
 * `rsync`
 
## Viewing files
 * `cat` shows entire content
 * `less` scroll through file
 * `head` show first lines of file
 * `tail` show last lines of file

## Creating aliases
 * `alias tsv='column -t -s$'\''\t'\'`
 * 
 
## Wildcards
 * `*.{txt,csv}`
 
## Piping

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Neat tricks

 * `cd -`: change to the previous directory
 * `realpath`: resolve all symbolic links
 * `rename`: bulk rename files 
 
## Accessing history

 * Up and down arrows keys
 * **Ctrl + R**: search your history
 
## Loops and the like
 * `for` loop
 * `xargs`
 
If you need to use loops, consider switching straight to nextflow instead (later lecture!)

## tmux

* Terminal multiplexer

## "modern unix" programs

 * `tldr`: Drop-in replacement for `man`
 * `rga`: alternative to `grep -R`, only searches code and text files. 
 
## Monitoring the system

 * `htop` or `glances`

## Bash - Bourne again shell

* Is a Unix shell:
  - GNU implementation of the Bourne shell (sh) from 1979
  - can be seen as interface between the user and the operating system (OS)
  - users interact with the shell using a terminal emulator (e.g. direct or via ssh)
  - interactive command language and a scripting language

* Other sh like shells: ![](images/shell.png){width=250px, align='right'}
  - **zsh**, ksh, ash


## Bash basic features

* filename wildcarding \
    <center>
    `*.{png,jpg}`
* piping
    - `cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdN`
* here documents \
    `cat << EOF` \
    `line1` \
    `line2` \
    `EOF`
* command substitution \
    <center>
    ```
    gzip `grep ".fastq" filelist.txt`
    ```
    \
    or \
    `gzip $(grep ".fastq" filelist.txt)`

## Bash basic features
* variables \
    <center>
    `VAR="foo"; echo $VAR`
* control structures for condition-testing \
  <center>
  ```if [ $FOO == $BAR ]; then ... fi```
  
* iteration (loops)
    <center>
    ` for ((i=1; i<=10; i++)); do echo Hello $i; done` \
    or \
    `i=1; while [ $i -le 10 ]; do echo Hello $i; ((i++)); done`

## Bash config files
Config files contain commands that are executed when loaded

| file                | loaded on |
|---------------------|---------|
| `/etc/profile`      | login   |
| `/etc/bashrc`       | login   |
| `~/.profile`        | login   |
| `~/.bash_profile`   | login   |
| `~/.bash_login`     | login   |
| `~/.bash_logout`    | login, executed on logout  |
| `~/.bashrc`         | interactive + n/login |

## Bash config files
Important and useful settings

* `$PATH` variable
  - `~/.bash_profile`
  - environment variable
  - specifies a set of directories where executable programs are located
  - program will be run from the first directory it is found in

e.g. \
<font size="4">
`$ echo $PATH` \
`$ /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/gringo/bin:/opt/pycharm/bin`
</font>

## Bash config files
Important and useful settings

* `$JAVA_HOME`
  - directory in which JRE is installed
* `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  - path to system and program libraries
* `$HISTSIZE` variable
  - specifies how many commands are saved in history \
  `$ echo $HISTSIZE`\
  `$ 1000`
* `$EDITOR`
  - sets the default text editor (e.g. nano, mcedit)

variables are set w/o leading `$`, e.g.\
<font size="4">
`$ JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk/1.12/` \
</font>


## Aliases
Unix shells allow aliasing commands, that is replacing a command by an arbitrary
string.

Used to abbreviate commands or add default options to a command, e.g.:

  * `alias l='ls -la'`
  * `alias tsv='column -t -s$'\''\t'\'`

*Hint*: to persist your aliases set them in `~/.bash_profile`

To remove an alias use:

  * `unalias <alias>`


## Aliases
To alias a command that should get an argument passed we can use bash functions()

e.g.\

```bash
mkcd() {                                                                                                                                                                                                
    local d="$1"                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    mkdir -p $d
    cd $d
}
```

Would use the first argument to create directory and directly change into it

`$ mkcd /tmp/a/b/c` \
`$ pwd` \
`$ /tmp/a/b/c` \

## Help me or RTFM

Most UNIX programs have a manual page to document the options
for the command

  * manual page can be accessed using \
  `$ man <program name>` \
  e.g. \
  `$ man cat`
  * will display detailed usage, options and examples for cat
  * man pages usually have the following sections:
<font size="4">
    - NAME
    - SYNOPSIS
    - DESCRIPTION
    - EXAMPLES
    - AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, COPYRIGHT, SEE ALSO
  
</font>


## Command line completion

Interacting with the OS using the command line implies a lot of typing:

  * long paths to input files
  * program arguments
  
Typing is cumbersome and prone to errors

  * Bash offers auto completion of:
    - paths
    - programs names
    - program options

  * Command line completion is achieved by typing a partial path/program and
  then pressing the **TAB** key (to the left of Q)


## Accessing history / edit commands

 * Up and down arrows keys
 * **Ctrl + R**: search your history
 
To move to the beginning of the current line, use **[Ctrl][A]** \
To move to the end of the current line, use **[Ctrl][E]** \
To move forward one word on the current line, use **[Alt][F]** \
To move backwards one word on the current line, use **[Alt][B]** \

You can also use key commands to do more than **move** around on the current line. They can be used to **manipulate** text on the current line as well.

To clear the characters on the line before the current cursor position, use **[Ctrl][U]** \
To clear the characters on the line after the current cursor position, use **[Ctrl][K]**


## The Unix filesystem

The Unix file system is a hierarchical tree of directories.

  * The filesystem root is: **/**
  * There are no drive letters as in Windows
  * Storage devices may be mounted into any place of the filesystem tree
  * No file extensions required but they are helpful (.fastq, tar.gz)

## Addressing files in the filesystem

Addressing files by their full or absolute path

  `/home/gringo/Documents/document1.txt`
  `/home/gringo/scripts/script.sh`



Addressing files by relative paths

  `$ cd /home/gringo/scripts` \
  `$ ls -l ../Documents/document1.txt` \
  <center><font size="4">equals to \
  `/home/gringo/Documents/document1.txt`</font></center> \
  `$ ls -l ../../` (?)


## Addressing files in the filesystem

Some shortcuts

  * `~ `  : tilde - the current user's home directory \
  <font size="4">`$ cd ~/scripts`</font>
  * `. `  : single dot - the current directory \
  <font size="4">`$ ./script.sh`</font>
  * `..`  : double dot - one directory above the current directory \
  <font size="4">`$ cd ../Documents`</font>
  * `cd -`: change to the previous directory
  * `pwd` : print full path of current directory
  * `pushd` : change + remember dir in directory stack \
  <font size="4">`$ pushd .`</font>
  * `popd` : return to last remembered dir in stack
  * `dirs` : show dir stack

  
## Soft links / Hard links

Sometimes it is required or useful to have a copy of a file
in another location, e.g. shorter path or program requirement.\
\
However, copying files is often problematic

  * duplicates data
  * is often slow (big files)
  * changes are not propagated

To avoid this we can use "virtual copies" named *links*


## Soft links / Hard links

  * Soft links (symbolic link, symlink)
  <font size="4">
    - visible as a link, but can still be used as if it is a file
    - is a filename pointing to another filename
    - work for files and directories
    - work across filesystem devices
    - when "original" is moved, renamed, deleted, the link is **dead**
    
  </font>
  
  <font size="4">   
  `$ ln -s <path to real file> <path to link>`\
  `$ ln -s /data/projects/2021/myPrj ~/myPrj` \
  `$ ls -l myPrj` \
  `$ lrwxrwxrwx 1 gringo users 20 Oct 7  2021 myPrj -> /data/projects/2021/myPrj` \
  `$ cd myPrj; pwd` \
  `$ /home/gringo/myPrj` \
  `$ pwd -P` \
  `$ /data/projects/2021/myPrj`
  
  </font>


## Soft links / Hard links


  * hard links
  <font size="4">
    - indistinguishable from a copied file
    - is a filename pointing to the same data as the original 
    - work only for files not directories
    - work only on same filesystem device
    - "original" can be moved, renamed, deleted
  
  </font>

  <font size="4">
  `$ ls -l myFile.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 1 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myFile.txt` \
  `$ ln <path to real file> <path to link>`\
  `$ ln myFile.txt myLink.txt` \
  `$ ls -l my*.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 2 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myFile.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 2 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myLink.txt` \

  </font>


*Note*: Every file is basically a hard link to the data

# Current methods and concepts in Bioinformatics

In this course students will learn about current bioinformatic tools, state of the art software development and data analysis frameworks, and code writing concepts which are fundamental for conducting scalable and reproducible data analyses.
Attendees should have basic skills and knowledge in Linux and command line usage.

## Logistics

 * The lecture takes place every Thursday from 09:00 to 09:45 in the seminar room, CCB 4th floor (	I80/8204M.04.383). **Due to the core-lecture, the first three lectures (2021-10-07, 2021-10-14, 2021-10-21) have been postponed to 10:00)**. 
 * There will be exercises for each lectures. We will discuss the solutions in the next lecture. Where applicable, exercises need to be handed in via GitHub or GitLab

## Housekeeping

From next week on, we will start with student presentations. 
You can either present

 * a Bioinformatics method
 * a cool R or Python package
 * your own code (we will review it together)

We will send around a google sheet where you can enter your topic. 
If you don't choose a topic, we will assign one. 

## Command line completion

Interacting with the OS using the command line implies a lot of typing:

  * long paths to input files
  * program arguments
  
Typing is cumbersome and prone to errors

  * Bash offers auto completion of:
    - paths
    - programs names
    - program options

  * Command line completion is achieved by typing a partial path/program and
  then pressing the **TAB** key (to the left of Q)


## Accessing history / edit commands

 * Up and down arrows keys
 * **Ctrl + R**: search your history
 
To move to the beginning of the current line, use **[Ctrl][A]** \
To move to the end of the current line, use **[Ctrl][E]** \
To move forward one word on the current line, use **[Alt][F]** \
To move backwards one word on the current line, use **[Alt][B]** \

You can also use key commands to do more than **move** around on the current line. They can be used to **manipulate** text on the current line as well.

To clear the characters on the line before the current cursor position, use **[Ctrl][U]** \
To clear the characters on the line after the current cursor position, use **[Ctrl][K]**


## The Unix filesystem

The Unix file system is a hierarchical tree of directories.

  * The filesystem root is: **/**
  * There are no drive letters as in Windows
  * Storage devices may be mounted into any place of the filesystem tree
  * No file extensions required but they are helpful (.fastq, tar.gz)
  
![](images/fs.png){width=500px, align='center'}

## Addressing files in the filesystem

Addressing files by their full or absolute path

  `/home/gringo/Documents/document1.txt`
  `/home/gringo/scripts/script.sh`



Addressing files by relative paths

  `$ cd /home/gringo/scripts` \
  `$ ls -l ../Documents/document1.txt` \
  <center><font size="4">equals to \
  `/home/gringo/Documents/document1.txt`</font></center> \
  `$ ls -l ../../` (?)


## Addressing files in the filesystem

Some shortcuts

  * `~ `  : tilde - the current user's home directory \
  <font size="4">`$ cd ~/scripts`</font>
  * `. `  : single dot - the current directory \
  <font size="4">`$ ./script.sh`</font>
  * `..`  : double dot - one directory above the current directory \
  <font size="4">`$ cd ../Documents`</font>
  * `cd -`: change to the previous directory
  * `pwd` : print full path of current directory
  * `pushd` : change + remember dir in directory stack \
  <font size="4">`$ pushd .`</font>
  * `popd` : return to last remembered dir in stack
  * `dirs` : show dir stack

  
## Soft links / Hard links

Sometimes it is required or useful to have a copy of a file
in another location, e.g. shorter path or program requirement.\
\
However, copying files is often problematic

  * duplicates data
  * is often slow (big files)
  * changes are not propagated

To avoid this we can use "virtual copies" named *links*


## Soft links / Hard links

  * Soft links (symbolic link, symlink)
  <font size="4">
    - visible as a link, but can still be used as if it is a file
    - is a filename pointing to another filename
    - work for files and directories
    - work across filesystem devices
    - when "original" is moved, renamed, deleted, the link is **dead**
    
  </font>
  
  <font size="4">   
  `$ ln -s <path to real file> <path to link>`\
  `$ ln -s /data/projects/2021/myPrj ~/myPrj` \
  `$ ls -l myPrj` \
  `$ lrwxrwxrwx 1 gringo users 20 Oct 7  2021 myPrj -> /data/projects/2021/myPrj` \
  `$ cd myPrj; pwd` \
  `$ /home/gringo/myPrj` \
  `$ pwd -P` or `$ realpath .`\
  `$ /data/projects/2021/myPrj`
  
  </font>


## Soft links / Hard links


  * hard links
  <font size="4">
    - indistinguishable from a copied file
    - is a filename pointing to the same data as the original 
    - work only for files not directories
    - work only on same filesystem device
    - "original" can be moved, renamed, deleted
  
  </font>

  <font size="4">
  `$ ls -l myFile.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 1 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myFile.txt` \
  `$ ln <path to real file> <path to link>`\
  `$ ln myFile.txt myLink.txt` \
  `$ ls -l my*.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 2 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myFile.txt` \
  `$ -rw-r--r-- 2 gringo users 11 Oct  7 13:40 myLink.txt` \

  </font>


*Note*: Every file is basically a hard link to the data



## Setting up passwordless authentication for ssh

* Generate a key pair:
   - private key: stays on your computer
   - public key: put it on the server
   
Using the public key the server can check that a request comes from
your computer. 

```bash
# generate a key pair
ssh-keygen

# copy the key pair on the server
ssh-copy-id user@zeus
```

## Basics
 * `cd `: return to home directory
 * `pwd`: get current working directory
 * `mkdir`, `rm`, `ls`, `rmdir`, `mv`
 * `tar xvf`, `tar cvf`
 * `gzip`, `gunzip`, `pigz`
 * `cp`, `ln`, `ln -s`
 * `rsync`
 * `tree`
 * `which`
 * `find`
 * `cut`
 
 
## Viewing files
 * `cat` shows entire content
 * `less` scroll through file
 * `head` show first lines of file
 * `tail` show last lines of file

## Creating aliases
 * `alias tsv='column -t -s$'\''\t'\'`
 
## Wildcards
 * `*.{txt,csv}`
 
## Piping

This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Neat tricks

 * `cd -`: change to the previous directory
 * `realpath`: resolve all symbolic links
 * `rename`: bulk rename files 
 * `killall NAME`: kill all processes that match the name (can only kill YOUR processes)
 
 
## Loops and the like
 * `for` loop
 * `xargs`
 
If you need to use loops, consider switching straight to nextflow instead (later lecture!)

## tmux

* Terminal multiplexer

## "modern unix" programs

 * `tldr`: Drop-in replacement for `man`
 * `rga`: alternative to `grep -R`, only searches code and text files. 
 
## Monitoring the system

 * `htop` or `glances`
 * `spacereporter` (only on CePH)
